#  SyllaBye üìù
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by all the syllabi being thrown at you the first week of classes? Do you hate having to go through 10 pages of a syllabus to find the information that really matters? SyllaBye allows you to upload pdfs of your syllabi and extracts the key information found in every syllabus. From grade information to how many tests, SyllaBye allows you to know what you need to know without all the other fluff! Say goodbye to syllabi and hello to SyllaBye.
